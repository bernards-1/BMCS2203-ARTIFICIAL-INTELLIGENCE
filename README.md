Project Title: YOLOv8 vs YOLOv11 Real-Time Detection Comparison

Description:
This project uses Streamlit and OpenCV to compare object detection performance 
between YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models in real-time using a webcam. 
The system loads two trained models and displays side-by-side detection outputs.

Files Included:
- scanobj.py → Main Streamlit application
- bestv8.pt → YOLOv8 trained model
- bestv11.pt → YOLOv11 trained model
- requirements.txt → Python dependencies for the project

- Run:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. streamlit run scanobj.py
